Description: Experimental Go programming language compiler
 This package provides assembler, compiler and linker for the Go
 programming language.  This is Google's Go implementation of the
 tool chain.
 .
 The Go programming language is an open source project to make
 programmers more productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and
 efficient.  Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs
 that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its
 novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction.
 Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of
 garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection.  It's a
 fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a
 dynamically typed, interpreted language.
 .
 Go is an experiment. We hope adventurous users will give it a try and
 see if they enjoy it. Not every programmer will, but we hope enough
 will find satisfaction in the approach it offers to justify further
 development. The language can (and still does) change between weekly
 releases, check http://golang.org/doc/devel/weekly.html before
 upgrading this package.
